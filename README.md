## Description

FreedomFit is an application that allows users to learn healthy-living related tips and sign up for fitness classes tailored for all fitness levels ran by certified personal trainers.

## Motivation for Development

FreedomFit came to life when a couple of friends decided to merge their expertise of fitness and nutrition to create educational courses that empower others to take charge of their health.

## User Story
```
AS A health conscious individual
I WANT to have a portal to sign up for fitness classes
SO THAT I can learn best practices and become healthier
```

## Project Requirements

The purpose of this project is to collaboratively build a MERN stack single-page application by combining a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end while also implementing user authentication with JWT for a user-focused platform.

* Use React for the front end.

* Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

* Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

* Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Include authentication (JWT).

* Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
